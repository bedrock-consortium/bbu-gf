## Introduction
The purpose of the Bedrock Business Utility is to provide a decentralized global public utility for trusted commerce.
The Bedrock Governance Framework (the "BBU-GF") serves as the *constitution* for the *Bedrock Business Utility*. It represents an instance of a [ToIP Layer One Public Utility Governance Framework](https://trustoverip.org/working-groups/governance-stack/) under the guidance of the [ToIP Utility Foundry Working Group](https://trustoverip.org/working-groups/utility-foundry/).

![toip-stack](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack/img/fig-1-toip-full-stack.png?raw=true)

The BBU-GF leverages the principles, policies, terminology, and standards necessary to enable trusted digital commerce based on decentralized identity.

A key objective of the BBU-GF is to address any concerns or risks that Consortium members may have as Utility participants. For example, compliance with Data Protection Regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA).

The purpose of the Bedrock Consortium is to administer decentralized governance for Bedrock Business Utility.

## Governance Framework

### Governance Documents
The BBU-GF formally consists of a set of interrelated documents that collectively form the governance model for the Directed Fund and the Utility that the Consortium manages. The documents are organized in three (3) categories; Blue = Normative, Yellow = Assessment, White = Informative.

### Core Principles
See [BBU Principles](./principles.md).

## Core Polices
In keeping with all Core Principles and especially the Decentralization by Design and Security by Design principles:

1. Policies, practices, procedures, and algorithms governing participation of [Stewards](./glossary.md) and operation of Nodes MUST follow all Core Principles.
2. The Consortium MUST publish the following Controlled Documents managed as specified by BBU Governing Bodies:​
a. Member Business Policies
b. Member Technical Policies​
c. Ledger Access Policies
​
### Inclusion
In keeping with the Inclusive by Design principles but in recognition of the permissioned write structure of the Bedrock Business Utility:

1. Read access to the Bedrock Business Utility MUST be open to all types of entities.  
2. Write access will be limited to members and non-members in good standing within the Consortium.
3. Write access will be limited to members and non-members that have signed the necessary ```Utility Agreements```. See ```Exibit B``` of the Participation Agreement.

### Trust Assurance
In keeping with all Core Principles and especially the Decentralization by Design principles:

1. The Consortium MUST specify policies, practices, and procedures for assessing conformance to the Bedrock Governance Framework by publishing and maintaining the Bedrock Trust Assurance Framework​ ​as a Controlled Document managed as specified by BBU Governing Bodies​. The Controlled Documents may leverage resources and guidance from the ToIP Foundation.
2. The Bedrock Consortium MUST publish a Bedrock Trust Mark Policies​ ​as a Controlled Document managed as specified by BBU Governing Bodies.​

## Economics
In keeping with the Sustainability principle:

1. The Consortium  MUST publish the ​Bedrock Economic Policies​ ​as a Controlled Document managed as specified by BBU Governing Bodies​ in conjunction with Consortium legal counsel.
2. The Consortium MUST manage Ledger Fees and any mechanism used for paying them to ensure economic viability and sustainability for the Consortium to keep with its charter as a non-profit public trust organization.
3. The Consortium MAY retain a qualified Auditor to publish an annual public audit of Consortium finances.

## Governance
The Bedrock Governance Framework Master Document and the Controlled Documents listed in ```Appendix A``` shall be revised from time to time. The policies in this section govern this process and procedures for managing document lifecycles.

### General
1. The Consortium MUST publish BBU Governance Bodies as a Controlled Document managed by the Board of Directors.
2. BBU Governance Bodies MUST specify the Bedrock Consortium Governing Body for each Controlled Document.
3. All BBU-GF documents, including Controlled Documents, MUST use keywords in policies as defined in [IETF RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
4. All BBU-GF documents MAY be revised to add non-normative
content, such as references to appendices, white papers, or other explanatory materials, without triggering a formal revision review process as defined in this ```Governance Section```.

### Source Control
All BBU-GF documents will reside in a [Github source control repository](https://github.com/bedrock-consortium/bbu-gf) and will use the associated [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/bedrock-consortium/bbu-gf/issues/) for change management.

### Approved Framework Process
1. Stable versions of the BBU-GF must be approved by the Board of Directors.
2. Approved versions need to be specified in the ```Version Control``` section of this document.
3. A static PDF file associated with the approved version MUST be stored in the ```/pdf/approved``` folder of the GitHub repo.
4. ```Appendix A``` of this document must be updated to point to the newly approved PDF file.

### Master Document Revisions
These policies apply to any normative revision to the present document, exclusive of ```Appendix A```.
1. Revisions to the BBU-GF Master Document MUST respect the Purpose and Core Principles.
2. The commencement of any revision process MUST be publicly announced by the Consortium no later than the time of commencement.
3. Decisions in the revision process is restricted to the Governing Board and SHOULD consider input from all BBU members.

2. A Controlled Document MUST be stored in and use the source control mechanisms established in this ```Governance Section```.
4. Revisions to a Controlled Document MUST be approved by the Governing Board before the revision takes effect.

## Appendix A: Controlled Documents
The following Controlled Documents are normative components of the BBU-GF. All framework content is published by the Consortium in three forms:

1. A static PDF document representing the entire governance framework in a single document.
    * [Latest compilation of material from the GitHub Repo](../../pdf/bedrock-business-utility-gf.pdf)
    * [Official Governing Board Approved Version](../../pdf/approved/bedrock-business-utility-gf-v1.pdf)
2. A sub-section of the [BBU website](https://bedrock-consortium.github.io/bbu-gf/) so that all documentation is easily navigated.  
3. Independent markdown files (```.md```) in the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/bedrock-consortium/bbu-gf).
