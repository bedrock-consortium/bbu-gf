## Build Process
This repo uses **GitHub Pages** to host the static HTML content that is generated by MkDocs. The ```gh-pages``` branch reflects the latest committed docs. See ```make pages```.

Use  ```make``` to manage the build process for this repo.

```
$ make

### Prepare Development Environment (MacOS)

### Generate HTML and PDF Docs
This repo uses ```mkdocs gh-deploy``` to push generated HTML content to GitHub. This process also creates a single PDF document in the ```pdf``` folder but the file is not pushed.
